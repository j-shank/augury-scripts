# augury-scripts
This is a repo containing some /really/ hacked together Augury scripts.  They might be useful for some starting points on analysis -- or they might be useful for nothing.  No guarantees!  Have fun.

# NOTE:
Please replace the string "JSHANK-GITHUB-SCRIPTS-REPLACE-THIS-WITH-YOUR-TOKEN" with your Augury API token to use these scripts.  Maybe one day I'll change this to an environment variable, but today is not that day.
